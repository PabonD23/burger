# Burger

## Description

Developed during a rigorous Coding Bootcamp. The condtions of this homework was to create a Buger logger using  MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM (Object Relational Mapping). Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
